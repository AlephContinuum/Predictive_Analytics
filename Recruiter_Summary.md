# Recruiter Summary – Predictive Analytics Platform

This project is a full production-grade AI system showcasing real-world engineering skills across multiple domains.

## Highlights for Recruiters:
- Built a complete end-to-end predictive analytics platform
- Integrated ML, GPT-based explanations, database, dashboards, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and a React frontend
- Demonstrates strong capability in:
  - Machine Learning
  - AI/LLM usage
  - Full-stack development
  - DevOps & deployment tooling
  - Cloud-ready infrastructure
  - Data visualization & analytics

## Why This Project Stands Out
- Combines backend, frontend, database, cloud, and AI components
- Shows ability to architect production-level systems
- Highly relevant to AI engineering, ML engineering, data engineering, and full-stack roles

## For Hiring Teams:
This project proves the candidate can:
- Build large systems independently
- Integrate multiple technologies cohesively
- Think end-to-end: data → model → UI → deployment → automation
- Deliver polished, industry-level software
